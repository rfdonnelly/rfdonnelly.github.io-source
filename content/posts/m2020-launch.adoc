It has been just under 5 years since I started working on Perseverance (Mars 2020 at the time).
I've moved on to another project (Europa Clipper) but Perseverance will always be a highlight of my career.
It was the project that brought me to JPL.

There are so many neat things about this mission but I'll just highlight the parts I was personally involved with.
I worked on the Lander Vision System (LVS) which will be used for both computer vision based autonomous landing and driving.
During the landing phase, the system will process images from the lander camera and match them against onboard satelitte imagery to figure out the rover's position.
This is the same function provided by GPS except the rover can't use GPS because there isn't a GPS satelite network around Mars.
So instead, we use a computer vision based approach to position.
Once the system delivers a position estimate, the flight computer will compare the position to a hazard map.
"This position bad, this other position good."
If the flight computer determines that the lander is headed to a hazardous landing site, it will perform a redirect manuever to a safe landing site.
This reduces landing error from a 60km ellipse to a ~18m circle.

Once Perseverance is safely on the ground, the same hardware will be reconfigured for autonomous driving using stereo vision.
As far as I know, this is a first for
